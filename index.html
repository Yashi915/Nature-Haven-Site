      <p>"The soft morning light calling us to the day, the comforting smell of rain, the glory of a sunset—nature has a
        way of calling us back, however far we may stray. This collection of nature quotes reminds us to revel in it, to

        itself in movement, flying exultantly under the stars."</p>

      <p>"These people have learned not from books, but in the fields, in the wood, on the river bank. Their teachers
        have been the birds themselves, when they sang to them, the sun when it left a glow of crimson behind it at
        setting, the very trees, and wild herbs."</p>
